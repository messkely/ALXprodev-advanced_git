# ALXprodev-advanced_git

---
Overview
This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and focuses on mastering advanced Git concepts, particularly the Git-Flow branching model. The primary objective is to simulate real-world collaborative workflows and develop a solid understanding of structured version control strategies used in professional software development environments.

Objectives
Initialize a Git repository and configure Git-Flow.

Understand and implement the Git-Flow branching model.

Learn to manage feature, release, and hotfix branches efficiently.

Collaborate using best practices for branching and merging.

Git-Flow Branch Types
main: Holds production-ready, stable code.

develop: Serves as the integration branch for ongoing development.

feature/: Created from develop to work on new features.

release/: Branches off develop to prepare for production deployment.

hotfix/: Branches directly from main to apply quick fixes, then merges back into both main and develop.

Project Setup
Install Git-Flow if it's not already installed.

Create and clone an empty repository named ALXprodev-advanced_git.

Create a develop branch and push it to the remote repository.

Initialize Git-Flow using default settings with the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git flow init -d
Create an empty README.md file and commit it to the develop branch.

Git-Flow Commands Cheat Sheet
bash
Copy
Edit
git flow init                      # Initialize Git-Flow with default branch settings
git flow feature start <name>     # Start a new feature branch from develop
git flow feature finish <name>    # Finish the feature and merge back into develop
git flow release start <version>  # Create a release branch from develop
git flow release finish <version> # Merge release into main and develop
git flow hotfix start <version>   # Start a hotfix branch from main
git flow hotfix finish <version>  # Merge hotfix into main and develop
